AsciiDoc Version 9
==================

Installing and configuring the latest version of AsciiDoc across
various distributions and platforms has never been easy and lots of
contributors have put in link:downloads.html#X1[lots of effort] to do
just this -- this never ending task is the bane of the Open Source
developer and user alike because invevitably distribution specific
packages are either missing or are soon out of date.

But it doesn't have to be like this -- AsciiDoc is a pure Python
application and could be distributed from the
http://pypi.python.org/[Cheese Shop] as a stand-alone platform
independent http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs[Python
