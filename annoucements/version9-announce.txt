Hi All

I just wanted to share with you the plans for AsciiDoc version 9
(http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/version9.html) and explain how we
got to this point.

Yannick Gringras emailed me late September enquiring of any plans for
a Python based installer for AsciiDoc -- he was already some of the
way there and volunteered to do the work. I was enthusiastic but it
was soon apparent that Yannick's efforts were outpacing mine so rather
than hold things back and in the light of the quite considerable
changes in the file layout we decided to start a new major release,
version 9, which would be managed by Yannick.

In the meantime I would release version 8.2.4 and continue continue to
be responsible for version 8.

The plan is that v8 will coexist with v9, the only ongoing v8
enhancements will be relatively minor and will not include any
architectural changes, v8 patches and modifications will be passed up
to v9. The AsciiDoc source and configuration file syntax will be the
same for both v8 and v9.

A welcome side benefit of this collaboration is that the AsciiDoc 8
distribution is now published as a Mercurial repostitory which also
resulted in a tidy up of the AAP build files.


Cheers, Stuart
