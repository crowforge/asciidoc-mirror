What is it?
-----------
AsciiDoc is an uncomplicated text document format for writing
articles, short documents, books and UNIX man pages.

AsciiDoc files can be translated to HTML, XHTML and DocBook (articles,
books and refentry documents) using the asciidoc(1) command. DocBook
can be post-processed to presentation formats such as HTML, PDF, roff,
and Postscript using readily available Open Source tools.

AsciiDoc is configurable: both the AsciiDoc source file syntax and the
backend output markups (which can be almost any type of SGML/XML
markup) can be customized and extended by user.

Python 2.3 or higher.
