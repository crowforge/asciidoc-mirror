1. AsciiDoc

     * The include1::[] block macro does not work inside ListingBlocks or
       FilterBlocks. Use include::[] instead.
     * Reported line numbers in diagnostic messages are sometimes wrong.
     * Block filters only work in a POSIX environment.
     * Embedding open brace characters { in argument values can cause
       incorrect argument substitution.
     * Attribute references in macro attribute lists can't be unescaped
       (with the exception of attribute list entry {0}).
     * Section numbering is incorrect when outputting HTML from a
       multi-part book type document. This is not a biggy since
       multi-part books are generally processed to DocBook.
     * A row of apostrophes in an inline context throws AsciiDoc into an
       endless loop.
     * Multiple comma separated command names in the manpage NAME section
       translate to a single DocBook refname instead of multiple refname
       elements.
